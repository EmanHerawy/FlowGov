Here’s the DAO test suite summary:

## DAO Test Suite — 47 Tests Total

### Basic configuration (3 tests)
- Basic contract read functions
- Configuration values
- Member management

### End-to-end DAO process (5 tests)
- `testFullCycleFundTreasuryProposal` — Full cycle: fund treasury
- `testFullCycleWithdrawTreasuryProposal` — Full cycle: withdraw from treasury
- `testFullCycleAddMemberProposal` — Full cycle: add member
- `testFullCycleRemoveMemberProposal` — Full cycle: remove member

- `testProposalExpiredFullCycle` — Full cycle when expired

### State transition tests (5 tests)
- Active → Passed
- Active → Rejected
- Active → Cancelled
- Passed → Executed
- Active → Expired

### Multi-proposal scenarios (3 tests)
- Multiple proposals in different states
- Sequential proposals from the same creator
- Concurrent voting on multiple proposals

### Treasury operation edge cases (4 tests)

- Insufficient funds handling
- Partial withdrawal

### Voting behavior edge cases (3 tests)
- Tie votes
- Single vote passes

## Coverage highlights
- End-to-end flows (proposal to execution)
- Treasury operations (fund/withdraw)
- Member management (add/remove)
- State transitions
- Stake handling
- Voting mechanics
- Security controls

These tests provide a blueprint to:
1. Implement tests incrementally
2. Update contract behavior as needed
3. Confirm correct DAO behavior
4. Surface edge cases and security issues
