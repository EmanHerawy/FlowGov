## 🎯 Hackathon Project Highlights 

### 🚀 Core Innovation #1: Trustless Automated Execution via Flow Transaction Scheduler

**The Revolution**: **Most DAOs require manual execution** - someone must call `executeProposal()` after voting ends. **We've eliminated this completely** - all proposals auto-execute via Flow's Transaction Scheduler!

**Why This Is Revolutionary:**

| Traditional DAOs | ToucanDAO (Our Solution) |
|------------------|--------------------------|
| ❌ **Manual Execution Required** | ✅ **Fully Automated Execution** |
| ❌ Someone must call `executeProposal()` | ✅ Scheduled automatically on deposit |
| ❌ Relies on trusted executor | ✅ **Trustless** - Flow network executes |
| ❌ Execution can be delayed/blocked | ✅ Executes precisely at scheduled time |
| ❌ Single point of failure | ✅ Distributed, network-level execution |
| ❌ Requires monitoring and manual work | ✅ **Zero maintenance** - fully automated |

**How It Works:**
```
1. Proposal Created (Pending)
2. Anyone Deposits → Status: Active → Automatically Scheduled for Execution
3. Voting Period (Community votes)
4. Voting Ends → Status Calculated (Passed/Rejected/Expired)
5. Cooldown Period (Safety mechanism)
6. 🚀 AUTOMATIC EXECUTION via Flow Transaction Scheduler (No human needed!)
7. Deposits Auto-Refunded
```

**Key Benefits:**
- ✅ **Trustless**: No reliance on specific individuals or multisig executors
- ✅ **Automated**: Execution happens automatically after cooldown
- ✅ **Precise Timing**: Executes at exact scheduled timestamp
- ✅ **No Single Point of Failure**: Flow network handles execution
- ✅ **Gas Optimization**: Fees estimated and paid automatically
- ✅ **Unstoppable**: Cannot be blocked or delayed by centralized parties

**Competitive Advantage:**
> **Most DAOs lack this critical feature!** They require manual execution which creates:
> - Execution delays
> - Trust requirements
> - Single points of failure
> - Maintenance overhead
>
> **ToucanDAO is fully automated and trustless** - execution happens automatically without any human intervention!

### 💎 Core Innovation #2: EVM Integration Enables Arbitrary Logic Execution

**The Game-Changer**: While we simplified the Cadence contract by removing complex features (NFTs, token locking, batch operations, etc.), **we can still execute them via EVM calls**!

**Why This Matters:**
- ✅ **Best of Both Worlds**: Simple, auditable Cadence contract + flexible EVM execution
- ✅ **No Contract Upgrades Needed**: Deploy new EVM contracts, propose calls via governance
- ✅ **Extensible Architecture**: Add functionality without modifying core Cadence contract
- ✅ **Bridge to Removed Features**: Execute removed features (NFTs, batch ops, etc.) via EVM
- ✅ **Execute Arbitrary Data**: Any EVM contract call can be executed through governance

**Example Workflow**: 
```
User wants NFT support → Deploy EVM NFT contract → Create EVMCall proposal → 
Community votes → Passes → Auto-executes after cooldown → NFT operation performed via EVM
All deposits automatically refunded!
```

#### 2. **Trustless Automated Execution** ⭐ **Revolutionary Feature**

**All proposals auto-execute** via Flow's Transaction Scheduler - **this is what most DAOs lack!**

**The Problem with Traditional DAOs:**
- Most DAOs require manual execution after voting ends
- Someone must monitor proposals and call `executeProposal()`
- Creates single points of failure and trust requirements
- Execution can be delayed or blocked
- Requires ongoing maintenance and monitoring

**Our Solution:**
- ✅ **Automatic Scheduling**: Proposals scheduled when deposited (no manual step)
- ✅ **Trustless Execution**: Flow network executes automatically - no trusted party needed
- ✅ **Cooldown Enforcement**: Built-in safety period before execution (prevents rash decisions)
- ✅ **Fee Automation**: FlowToken fees automatically estimated and paid
- ✅ **Handler Pattern**: Dedicated transaction handler executes proposals
- ✅ **Status-Based Execution**: Passed proposals execute actions, rejected/expired skip execution
- ✅ **Precise Timing**: Executes at exact scheduled timestamp (after cooldown)
- ✅ **Zero Maintenance**: No monitoring, no manual intervention, fully automated

**Why This Matters:**
```
Traditional DAO Flow:
Proposal → Vote → Wait... → Someone monitors → Manually calls execute() → Execution

ToucanDAO Flow:
Proposal → Vote → Automatically scheduled → Auto-executes → Done!
```

**Impact**: This makes ToucanDAO **trustless and fully automated** - a major competitive advantage over most existing DAOs!

#### 3. **Automatic Deposit Refunds** ⭐

- **Consumer-scale**: Built for responsive, high-throughput crypto applications
- **Developer-friendly**: Purpose-built to help builders ship faster without compromise

### What is Forte

Forte is the Flow network upgrade that brings **composability and automation** natively to Flow. Two new primitives, **Actions** and **Workflows**, let developers compose reusable, protocol-agnostic workflows with onchain time-based triggers.

**Forte enables builders to:**
- Create standardized DeFi actions
- Schedule transactions with time-based triggers
- Build onchain workflows that automate complex processes
- Compose reusable, protocol-agnostic building blocks
- Get an edge with native automation features

Forte transforms how developers build on Flow by making smart contract automation and composability first-class citizens of the network.

| **🆕 AI Governance Agent** | Conversational interface for proposal understanding | Democratizes governance access |
| **🆕 Proposal Dashboard** | Real-time proposal status and voting information | Enhanced user experience |
| **🆕 Chat Interface** | Natural language queries about DAO state | Makes governance accessible |

### 🔄 **What We Changed** (Modified Features)

| Original Feature | Modification | Reason |
|-----------------|--------------|--------|
| **Multi-Sig System** | → **Proposal Voting System** | More democratic, token-weighted |
| **Project Resource (Nested)** | → **Flat Contract Structure** | Simpler, easier to understand |
| **Immediate Execution** | → **Scheduled Execution** | Safety via cooldown periods |
| **Manual State Updates** | → **Dynamic Status Calculation** | Automatic, error-resistant |
| **Fixed Threshold Voting** | → **Quorum + Majority Rules** | More flexible, differentiated requirements |
| **Signer-Based Access** | → **Token-Holder Based** | Economic stake required |
| **Nested Treasury** | → **Contract-Level Treasury** | Simpler structure, supports multiple token types |
| **Action UUIDs** | → **Sequential Proposal IDs** | Simpler tracking |
| **Boolean Approval** | → **Yes/No Vote Counts** | More nuanced decision making |

### ❌ **What We Removed** (Features Not Included)

| Removed Feature | Original Purpose | Why Removed | Can Execute Via EVM? |
|----------------|------------------|-------------|---------------------|
| **Funding Cycles** | Fundraising rounds with goals | Not needed for governance focus | ✅ Yes (via EVM contract) |
| **Token Purchase/Donation** | Buy project tokens, issue based on rate | Simplified to direct deposits | ✅ Yes (via EVM contract) |
| **NFT Support** | NFT treasury and catalog integration | Outside governance scope | ✅ Yes (via EVM contract) |
| **Token Locking/Vesting** | Time-locked token transfers | Complexity for governance use case | ✅ Yes (via EVM contract) |
| **Batch Operations** | Batch withdrawals and mints | Can be done via multiple proposals | ✅ Yes (via EVM contract) |
| **Payout System** | Automatic percentage distributions | Not needed for simple governance | ✅ Yes (via EVM contract) |
| **Flow Staking** | Flow → stFlow conversion | DeFi feature, not governance | ✅ Yes (via EVM contract) |
| **Token Burning** | Destroy tokens | Not needed for governance | ✅ Yes (via EVM contract) |
| **Project Collection** | Multiple projects per account | Single DAO model simpler | ❌ Architectural decision |
| **Overflow System** | Separate overflow vault | Simple treasury sufficient | ✅ Yes (via EVM contract) |
| **Emerald City Tax** | 2% tax on purchases | No purchase mechanism | ✅ Yes (via EVM contract) |

**💡 Key Insight**: **Most removed features can still be executed via EVM call proposals!**

The EVM integration enables the DAO to execute **arbitrary logic** not natively supported by Cadence structures. This means:
- ✅ Removed features (NFT operations, batch operations, etc.) can be implemented as EVM contracts
- ✅ DAO can execute them via `CreateEVMCallProposal` transactions
- ✅ No need to modify the Cadence contract - just deploy EVM contracts and propose calls
- ✅ Extensible architecture without contract upgrades

**Note**: Some features were removed due to **hackathon time constraints** and architectural simplification. The EVM integration provides a bridge to execute these features when needed.

### 🎯 **What We Kept** (Core Concepts Retained)

| Feature | Implementation | Notes |
|---------|----------------|-------|
| **Treasury Management** | Contract-level `Treasury` resource | Supports multiple token types dynamically |
| **Multi-Actor Decisions** | Proposal voting + quorum | Democratic decision making |
| **Action-Based Execution** | `Action` struct with type enum | Flexible action framework |
| **Events System** | 7 governance-focused events | Proposal lifecycle tracking |
| **Access Control** | Cadence entitlements | Secure member/admin access |
| **Validation & Safety** | Assertions and preconditions | Prevents invalid operations |

    Note over Scheduler: Cooldown period passes
    Scheduler->>DAO: executeProposal()
    DAO->>DAO: Status = EXPIRED (no action)
    DAO->>Depositor: Refund deposit
```

#### Scenario 4: Cancelled Proposal

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Creator as Proposal Creator
    participant DAO as ToucanDAO

    Creator->>DAO: createProposal()
    Note over DAO: Status: PENDING
    
    Creator->>DAO: cancelProposal(proposalId)
    DAO->>DAO: Validate creator == signer.address
    DAO->>DAO: Validate status == PENDING or ACTIVE
    DAO->>DAO: If ACTIVE, validate totalVotes == 0
    DAO->>DAO: Status = CANCELLED
    DAO->>Creator: Refund deposit immediately
```

#### Scenario 5: Admin Operation (2/3 Quorum Required)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant Admin1 as Admin Member 1
    participant Admin2 as Admin Member 2
    participant Admin3 as Admin Member 3
    participant DAO as ToucanDAO

    Note over DAO: Total Members = 3
    Note over DAO: Admin Operation requires 2/3 = 2 votes
    
    Admin1->>DAO: vote(proposalId, true)
    DAO->>DAO: yesVotes = 1
    
    Admin2->>DAO: vote(proposalId, true)
    DAO->>DAO: yesVotes = 2
    
    Note over DAO: Voting period ends
    Note over DAO: Total votes = 2 >= 2/3 (✓)
    Note over DAO: Yes (2) > No (0) (✓)
    DAO->>DAO: Status = PASSED
```

### Key Rules & Requirements

| Stage | Requirement | Validation |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| **Creation** | Any account | None (anyone can propose) |
| **Activation** | Deposit ≥ `minimumProposalStake` (default: 10.0 ToucanTokens) | `depositAmount >= minimumProposalStake` |
| **Voting** | Must hold ToucanTokens | `hasToucanTokenBalance(address) == true` |
| **Quorum (Regular)** | Votes ≥ `minimumQuorumNumber` (default: 3.0) | `totalVotes >= minimumQuorumNumber` |
| **Quorum (Admin)** | Votes ≥ 2/3 of total members | `totalVotes >= ceil(2/3 * memberCount)` |
| **Passing** | Yes votes > No votes | `yesVotes > noVotes` |
| **Cancellation** | Creator only, Pending or Active with no votes | `creator == signer && (Pending \|\| Active && totalVotes == 0)` |
| **Execution** | Must pass cooldown period | `currentTime >= expiryTimestamp + cooldownPeriod` |

### Time Periods

- **Voting Period**: `defaultVotingPeriod` (default: 43,200 seconds = 12 hours)
- **Cooldown Period**: `defaultCooldownPeriod` (default: 43,200 seconds = 12 hours)
- **Execution Time**: `expiryTimestamp + cooldownPeriod + 1.0 seconds`

### Proposal Types

1. **WithdrawTreasury**: Withdraw tokens from DAO treasury to recipient
2. **AdminBasedOperation**: Add/remove members, update configuration
3. **EVMCall**: **Execute arbitrary EVM contract calls** through COA - enables removed features!

### 🎯 Why EVM Calls Are Revolutionary

The EVM integration provides **unprecedented flexibility** for DAO governance:

**Traditional Approach (Original Toucans):**
- All logic must be implemented in Cadence
- Contract upgrades required for new features
- Complex features increase contract size

**Our Approach (ToucanDAO):**
- Core governance in Cadence (simple, secure, auditable)
- Extended logic via EVM contracts (flexible, upgradeable)
- Execute **arbitrary data** - any EVM contract call
- **Bridge removed features** without contract modifications

**Example**: Want NFT support? Deploy an EVM NFT contract and create an `EVMCall` proposal to call it!

### 🔄 Proposal Lifecycle Highlights

**Key Features Summary:**

1. **🔄 Auto-Execution**: All proposals execute automatically after cooldown
2. **💰 Auto-Refunds**: Deposits refunded automatically for all outcomes
3. **👥 Community Support**: Anyone can deposit to activate proposals (not just creator)
4. **⏰ Time-Based**: Proposals expire if not supported or voted on
5. **🤖 AI Assistance**: Frontend AI agent helps users understand and vote on proposals
6. **🔗 EVM Bridge**: Execute removed features via EVM calls - best of both worlds!
