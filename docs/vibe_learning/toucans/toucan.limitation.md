Since our proposal idea is to enable automatic  execution of DAO proposals,
it's important to note that the current contract **cannot** schedule delayed execution of `finalizeAction`.

Here's why:

### **Current Limitations:**

1. **Immediate execution**: Once a proposal reaches the threshold, `finalizeAction` is called immediately (line 1484-1486 in `voteOnProjectAction`)
2. **No time tracking**: `MultiSignAction` resource has no timestamp fields
3. **No scheduling mechanism**: There's no way to specify "execute this at time X"
4. **No periodic check system**: No background process to check if scheduled actions are ready
