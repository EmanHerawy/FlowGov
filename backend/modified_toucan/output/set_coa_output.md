  3. Configure the DAO to use the FlowTreasury contract:
     - Set EVM treasury contract address in ToucanDAO config
     - Set COA capability in ToucanDAO: cadence/transactions/SetCOACapability.cdc (if exists)
     - Create EVM call proposals: cadence/transactions/CreateEVMCallProposal.cdc

Next steps:
  1. Check transaction logs for COA address
  2. If FlowTreasury was deployed, check logs for deployed contract address
  3. Configure the DAO to use the FlowTreasury contract:
     - Set EVM treasury contract address in ToucanDAO config
     - Set COA capability in ToucanDAO: cadence/transactions/SetCOACapability.cdc (if exists)
     - Create EVM call proposals: cadence/transactions/CreateEVMCallProposal.cdc

[1;33mImportant:[0m
  - COA resource: /storage/evm
  - Public capability: /public/evm
  - FlowTreasury contract owner: The COA that deployed it
  - Use the deployed FlowTreasury address for DAO EVM call proposals

[0;34mAdditional transactions:[0m
  - Fund existing COA: cadence/transactions/FundCOA.cdc <amount>
